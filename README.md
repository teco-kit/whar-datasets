# WHAR Datasets

This library provides data handling support for popular WHAR (Wearbale Human Activity Recognition) datasets including

<!-- - metadata descriptions in [DCAT-AP](https://www.dcat-ap.de/) and [Croissant](https://github.com/mlcommons/croissant) -->
- downloading from original source
- parsing into a standardized data format
- configuration-driven preprocessing, splitting, normalization, and more
- integration with pytorch and tensorflow

# How to Install

```
pip install "git+https://github.com/teco-kit/whar-datasets.git"
```

This installs the library into the active environment.

# How To Use

```python
from whar_datasets.adapters.torch_adapter import TorchAdapter
from whar_datasets.support.getter import WHARDatasetID, get_whar_cfg

cfg = get_whar_cfg(WHARDatasetID.UCI_HAR)
dataset = TorchAdapter(cfg)

train_loader, val_loader, test_loader = dataset.get_dataloaders(batch_size=32)
```

Not yet natively supported WHAR datasets can be integrated via a custom configuration (with parser).
